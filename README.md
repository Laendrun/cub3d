#CUB3D

## Intro

I tried to build a functionning version to have a better understanding of how the raycasting thing is working.

...and I managed to build something that works thanks to an awesome tutorial (linked below).

The raycasting part is based on this awesome tutorial :

[RayCasting Tutorial](https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/RayCastingTutorial/wiki/RayCasting)

## Compiling

```sh
make
```

## Running

```sh
./cub3d maps/map.cub
```

## Controls

- `W` or `UP` to go forward.
- `S` or `DOWN` to go backward.
- `A` or `LEFT` to rotate counter clockwise.
- `D` or `RIGHT` to rotate clockwise.
- `M` toggles the minimap.
